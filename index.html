    <h1>🥐 Origin of Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      The croissant began as the Austrian kipfel but became French the moment
      people began to make it with puffed pastry, which is a French innovation,”
      says Chevallier. “It has fully taken root in its adopted land.” Order a
      kipfel in Austria or Germany today and you'll likely be handed a
      crescent-shaped cookie.
